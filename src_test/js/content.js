// here we use SHARED message handlers, so all the contexts support the same
// commands. but this is NOT typical messaging system usage, since you usually
// want each context to handle different commands. for this you don't need
// handlers factory as used below. simply create individual `handlers` object
// for each context and pass it to msg.init() call. in case you don't need the
// context to support any commands, but want the context to cooperate with the
// rest of the extension via messaging system (you want to know when new
// instance of given context is created / destroyed, or you want to be able to
// issue command requests from this context), you may simply omit the
// `handlers` parameter for good when invoking msg.init()
